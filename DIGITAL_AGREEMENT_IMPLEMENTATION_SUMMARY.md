## Technical Implementation

### Backend Components

#### Models
- `DigitalAgreement` model for storing agreement data and status

#### Controllers

  - Creating and retrieving digital agreements
  - PDF copying and download
  - Surepass eSign initiation and webhook handling
  - Admin approval/rejection workflows

#### Routes
- `/api/digital-agreements/*` endpoints for franchise users
- `/api/digital-agreements/admin/*` endpoints for administrators

### Frontend Components

#### Franchise Dashboard
- Updated `DigitalAgreement.jsx` component with:
  - PDF download functionality
  - eSign initiation and transaction submission
  - Status display and notifications

#### Admin Dashboard
- New `ManageDigitalAgreements.jsx` component with:
  - List view of all digital agreements
  - Approval/rejection workflow
  - Signed PDF download capability

### API Integrations

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Template Setup
1. Create your franchise agreement as a PDF document
2. Save it as `franchise_agreement_template.pdf`
3. Place it in the `Backend/uploads/` directory
4. Ensure the file has appropriate read permissions

### 2. Directory Setup
The system automatically creates the required directories:
- `Backend/uploads/agreements/` - For user-specific PDF copies
- `Backend/uploads/signed-agreements/` - For signed documents

### 3. Surepass Configuration
1. Obtain Surepass API credentials
2. Add them to the admin settings via the "Surepass Settings" tab
3. Configure eSign signature positions in the frontend component

## Workflow

1. **Agreement Creation**: When a franchise user accesses the Digital Agreement tab, a copy of the master template is created with their name.

2. **PDF Download**: Users can download their personalized PDF copy.

3. **eSign Process**: Users initiate the Surepass eSign process, which redirects them to the Surepass signing portal.

4. **Submission**: After signing, users submit the transaction ID through the dashboard.

5. **Admin Review**: Administrators review submitted agreements in the new "Digital Agreements" section.

6. **Approval/Rejection**: Admins can approve valid agreements or reject invalid ones with a reason.

7. **Document Storage**: All generated and signed documents are stored securely on the server.

## Environment Configuration

The implementation uses the following environment variables:
- `SUREPASS_API_KEY`: For authenticating with Surepass APIs
- `FRONTEND_URL`: For redirect URLs after eSign process
- `BACKEND_URL`: For webhook endpoints

## Next Steps

1. Place your franchise agreement template in the uploads directory
2. Configure Surepass API credentials in the admin settings
3. Test the complete workflow with actual PDF documents and eSign transactions
4. Adjust eSign signature positions based on your template layout
5. Implement additional security measures for document storage and access

## Dependencies

- Built-in Node.js file system operations (no external PDF libraries needed)
- `axios`: For API requests to Surepass
- Existing project dependencies (Express, Mongoose, etc.)

This simplified implementation provides a reliable digital agreement workflow that integrates seamlessly with the existing CreditDost platform architecture.
